# Project Notes

## Backlog
* shrink the image size down
* cut to just the sides
* try just using a generator and having the image difference be the cost function
* try the GANs approach
* read up on different architecture

## Results to show
* Results over time
* Example on the 16:9
* Example on the 4:3
    * fixed background vs action sceen
* Look at other animated shows (Simpsons etc)
* Look at the wizard of oz

## Notes
Looked into OpenAI's Image GPT (https://openai.com/blog/image-gpt/). It may take too long to run even if it's just transfer learning on this model.
Code is on github (https://github.com/openai/image-gpt). Was created with TensorFlow.
